Docker LEMP example
========================

This example demonstrate how you can setup fully functional LEMP environment using Docker.

If you are not familiar with Docker and you don't like to read long articles, here is [a simple introduction](docker-introduction) (skip the backstory :P).

How can I run it?
--------------
You just need to run `bin/start.sh` from project root directory.

It's LEGEN...

```
Wait for 5-10min until Docker downloads/builds all neccessery images and runs your containers.
```

...DERY! Now, you should have fully functional LEMP environment.

Don't worry it takes that long only on first run :)
